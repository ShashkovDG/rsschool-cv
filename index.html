                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>I have never worked in the field of information technology, but I have always been interested in this field since the advent of the first computer. 
                    I attended computer science courses at school. At university, my classes were related to computer science, but with an emphasis on economics. 
                    Unfortunately for myself, I recently delved into programming. Before the courses, I only studied HTML on my own, and in addition to the duties of the manager, 
                    I additionally used the employer's website, I was engaged in filling the site. From 2018 to 2020, I took programming courses in C, C++, C# and underwent professional retraining. 
                    As a result, I ran into problems when writing software, since the C# language itself and especially the UWP platform I wrote on were created relatively recently and there is very 
                    little information in Russian, and I know English very poorly and mostly use a translator. After a long search for information and reading documentation in English, 
                    I lost the desire to do programming. But after a while I found out about the RS SCHOOL courses and decided to try myself in the field of web programming.</p>

                        <p>No work experience. Since during the training we were only mentioned about Git and GitGub, but not trained, at the time of writing the program, 
                            the version control system was not used. Perhaps I will add my project created on UWP later.</p>

                <h2>CODE EXAMPLE</h2>
                <p>Maybe not very smart, but encryption was invented by me personally for my program. I implemented it so that during authorization it was possible to save the password to a file, 
                 but after opening this file locally, instead of the password there was an encrypted text of characters. Later I decided that all the text in the program and in its chat should 
                    be encrypted before writing to the database so that the data can be read only through the program.</p>
